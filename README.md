# Window Manager 3D Football with Glowing Threads

This project demonstrates an interactive 3D visualization using **Three.js**. It allows for the creation of multiple "football" meshes (icosahedrons) and dynamically connects them with glowing threads based on the arrangement of your browser windows. The footballs move in real-time as the user resizes and moves their windows.

## Features

- **3D Footballs**: Football-like icosahedrons are rendered as 3D shapes.
- **Glowing Connecting Threads**: Glowing lines dynamically connect the footballs.
- **Responsive**: The scene automatically adjusts when the browser window is resized or moved.
- **Window Manager**: A custom `WindowManager` library tracks the shape and position of all windows.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The footballs and threads update smoothly with window movements.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A powerful 3D JavaScript library used to render 3D objects.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Modern JavaScript for all interactivity and logic.
- **HTML5 & CSS**: For rendering the 3D canvas and styling.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/window-manager-3d-football.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses **Three.js** and assumes you're using a basic web server to serve the files.

If you are using `npm` or `yarn`, first install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

OR

```bash
yarn install
```

If you're not using any package manager, download **Three.js** manually from the official site: [https://threejs.org/](https://threejs.org/).

### 3. Open the Project in a Browser

To view the project, open the HTML file in a browser. Alternatively, if you set up a local server:

```bash
npm run start
```

### 4. Explore the Project

Once the project is running in your browser:

- Move your browser window to see how the footballs and threads adjust in real-time.
- Resize the window to see the footballs and threads update accordingly.
- Each time you move or resize a window, the position and connection of the footballs change dynamically.

## How It Works

1. **Football Creation**:
   Each football is a 3D **icosahedron geometry** mesh, created using **Three.js** and positioned according to the window's position.
   
2. **Window Tracking**:
   The `WindowManager` tracks the position and dimensions of all open windows. Each window has a football placed at its center. The position is updated as the window is resized or moved.

3. **Connections**:
   A dynamic line (thread) connects each pair of footballs. The threads are drawn using `THREE.Line` and updated every frame to reflect the current positions of the footballs.

4. **Responsive Rendering**:
   When the user resizes the browser window, the scene is resized to match. The camera also adjusts, keeping the footballs and threads correctly positioned.

5. **Smooth Animation**:
   The positions of the footballs and connections are interpolated to create smooth transitions during window movement.

## Customization

- **Football Shape**: You can change the shape of the footballs by using different geometries, such as `THREE.SphereGeometry` or `THREE.BoxGeometry`.
- **Thread Glow**: The connecting threads can be enhanced by using materials with glow properties, such as `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial` with an `emissive` color.
- **Window Shape Change Callback**: Customize how the windows affect the 3D visualization by editing the `setWinShapeChangeCallback()` function in the `WindowManager` class.
